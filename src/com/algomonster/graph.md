#### BFS on graph

#### DFS on graph

#### BFS or DFS

BFS on a graph is better at:

- finding *shortest distance* between 2 vertices
- *graph of unknown size* e.g. word ladder, or even infinite size, e.g. knight shortest path

DFS on a graph is better at:

- uses *less memory than BFS for wide graphs*, since BFS has to keep all the nodes in the queue, and for wide graphs this can be quite large.

- finding nodes far away from the root, e.g. looking for an exit in a maze
