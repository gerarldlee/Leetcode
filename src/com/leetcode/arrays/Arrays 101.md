Arrays
====

An Array is a collection of items. The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, games, booksâ€”anything really. The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. Because they're stored together, checking through the entire collection of items is straightforward.



### Capacity vs Length

Capacity - how much the array could potentially hold

Length or size - how many values the array is currently holding

Rule of thumb - when the length or size reaches 70% of capacity, allocate and create a new array and copy the old array to the new array.



### Insert

At the end of the array

```java
if (size < capacity) {
	array[size] = value;
}
else {
    // we need to allocate new array
}
```



At the beginning of the array

```java
// move the values to its next index, provided that the size has not reached capacity
for (int i=array.length-1; i>0; i++) {
    array[i] = array[i-1];
}
// insert the value
array[0] = value;
```



At the middle of the array

```java
// move the values to its next index, provided that the size has not reached capacity
for (int i=array.length-1; i>mid; i++) {
    array[i] = array[i-1];
}
// insert the value
array[mid] = value;
```



### Delete

At the end of the array

```java
if (size > 0) {
    array[size] = 0;	// remove the value and decrement the size
    size--;
}
```



At the beginning of the array

```java
// move the values to its previous index
for (int i=array.length-2; i>=0; i++) {
    array[i] = array[i+1];
}
array[size] = 0;	// remove the last value since it has been copied already
```



At the middle of the array

```java
// move the values to its previous index
for (int i=array.length-2; i>=mid; i++) {
    array[i] = array[i+1];
}
array[size] = 0;
```



### Search

- linear search - iterate the values of the array and compare if found
- binary search - if the array is in sorted order
- two pointer search - just to cut the search time in half



### In-place operations

- means modifying the input array to save in space complexity



### Two Pointer technique

- same direction for both pointers
- opposite direction
- fixed width



### Circular arrays

- unbounded array that connects the end to its beginning
