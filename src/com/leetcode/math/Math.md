## Long Division

1. take care of the edge cases such as 
   1. when the dividend = 0, 
   2. when the dividend is less than the divisor, return 0
2. know the sign. If any of the dividend or divisor is negative, and the other one positive, then its a negative. Otherwise its positive
3. Convert both of them to positive via absolute value
4. do a recursion
   1. base case: when dividend < divisor, return 0
   2. find the largest multiple such that divisor + divisor <= dividend.
