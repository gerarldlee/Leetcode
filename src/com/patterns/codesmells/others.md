## Incomplete Library Class

### Signs and Symptoms
Sooner or later, libraries stop meeting user needs. The only solution to the problem – changing the library – is often impossible since the library is read-only.

### Treatment
- To introduce a few methods to a library class, use Introduce Foreign Method.

- For big changes in a class library, use Introduce Local Extension.
