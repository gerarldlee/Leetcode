Most Frequent Scale: Enterprise

Refactored Solution Name: Enterprise Architecture Planning

Refactored Solution Type: Process

Root Causes: Haste, Apathy, Narrow-Mindedness

Unbalanced Forces: Management of Change, Resources, Technology Transfer

Anecdotal Evidence: "Can I have my own island (of automation)?"

# Jumble

# Stovepipe system

AntiPattern Name: Stovepipe System

Also Known As: Legacy System, Uncle Sam Special, Ad Hoc Integration

Most Frequent Scale: System

Refactored Solution Name: Architecture Framework

Refactored Solution Type: Software

Root Causes: Haste, Avarice, Ignorance, Sloth

Unbalanced Forces: Management of Complexity, Change

Anecdotal Evidence: "The software project is way over-budget; it has slipped its schedule repeatedly; my users still don't get the expected features; and I can't modify the system. Every component is a stovepipe."

# Cover Your Assets

Unbalanced Forces: Management of Technology Transfer, Management of Change

Anecdotal Evidence:
We have often encountered software projects that claim their architecture is based upon a particular vendor or product line.

Most Frequent Scale: System

Refactored Solution Name: Architecture Mining

Refactored Solution Type: Process

Root Causes: Pride, Ignorance

Unbalanced Forces: Management of Change, Technology Transfer

Anecdotal Evidence: "Our problem is unique." Software developers generally have minimal knowledge of each other's code. Even widely used software packages available in source code rarely have more than one experienced developer for each program.

# The Grand Old Duke of York

Also Known As: Everyone Charges Up the Hill, Lack of Architecture Instinct, Abstractionists versus Implementationists

Anecdotal Evidence:
Experts report that only 1 in 5 software developers is able to define good abstractions On hearing this, a practicing software architect retorted, "It's more like 1 out of 50."
